# Stablecoin Anomaly Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect investing anomalies in the cryptocurrency market, specifically focusing on stablecoins. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we endeavor to predict instances when stablecoins such as USDT (Tether), USDC (USD Coin), and DAI are likely to depeg from their anchored value. The detection of such anomalies is crucial for investors, traders, and financial analysts who seek to mitigate risks and understand market dynamics more deeply.

## Motivation

The stability of stablecoins is pivotal in the cryptocurrency market, providing a relatively safe haven during volatile periods. However, instances of depegging can lead to significant market disruptions. By identifying depegging events, our project aims to contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment.
